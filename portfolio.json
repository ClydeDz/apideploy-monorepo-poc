We started designing the website using <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher\">Microsoft Publisher</a> and then exported the HTML files from that. Probably not the best idea as the output had all styles inline and wasn&#39;t responsive at all. Some graphics used on the site was designed in <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/powerpoint\">Microsoft PowerPoint</a>. Only the contact us page on the website had some PHP code to send the contents of the form as an email. </p>\n<p>To help us out with hosting, we were provided with a contact who was responsible for acquiring the domain and hosting for the website. This person briefly explained the process and asked us to deploy the website files via FTP.  </p>\n<p>Eventually, we got there. Everyone who visited the website liked it and we got a great real-world experience while still in college.</p>\n",

We taught 36 Computer Science students and gave an online presence to 1 NGO – Healing Dove Foundation. </p>\n<p>I conceptualized this event remotely and put a team together to help me pull this event off. A lot of the pre-event duration was contacting NGO&#39;s, sponsors, and finding locations for the event. I  also had to prepare content that we would be delivering at the event and also had to train up the team to then be able to mentor students. </p>\n<p>The 2-day event itself was very fast-paced. We delivered presentations, then jumped into hands-on sessions where the students worked in groups to develop a WordPress site for the non-profit. Students in each group were paired so that they could learn faster, share knowledge and frequently communicate the whole time. There were a couple of graphic designers on-site to assist with any graphical requirements that any of the groups had. Representatives from the NGO were also on-site to talk about their requirements and what they&#39;d like to get out of this 2-day event. We were aiming to give the students a work-like environment during these 2-days and having them communicate directly with other stakeholders was a key skill to learn. At the end of the 2-day event, each group presented their learnings and the website before the entire audience. </p>\n<p>Read more about this event <a href=\"https://lightandsparknpo.github.io/2019-11-20-ruia-mumbai-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n",
