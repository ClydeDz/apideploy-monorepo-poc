We taught 36 Computer Science students and gave an online presence to 1 NGO – Healing Dove Foundation. </p>\n<p>I conceptualized this event remotely and put a team together to help me pull this event off. A lot of the pre-event duration was contacting NGO&#39;s, sponsors, and finding locations for the event. I  also had to prepare content that we would be delivering at the event and also had to train up the team to then be able to mentor students. </p>\n<p>The 2-day event itself was very fast-paced. We delivered presentations, then jumped into hands-on sessions where the students worked in groups to develop a WordPress site for the non-profit. Students in each group were paired so that they could learn faster, share knowledge and frequently communicate the whole time. There were a couple of graphic designers on-site to assist with any graphical requirements that any of the groups had. Representatives from the NGO were also on-site to talk about their requirements and what they&#39;d like to get out of this 2-day event. We were aiming to give the students a work-like environment during these 2-days and having them communicate directly with other stakeholders was a key skill to learn. At the end of the 2-day event, each group presented their learnings and the website before the entire audience. </p>\n<p>Read more about this event <a href=\"https://lightandsparknpo.github.io/2019-11-20-ruia-mumbai-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n",
